            This was my very first big project—and honestly, it changed how I saw myself as a developer.<br><br>
Before this, I had only worked with Tkinter for small desktop apps. Then my mom introduced me to this project at the Moratuwa Divisional Secretariat office. They had a simple but frustrating problem: their file rack system was completely manual. If someone wanted to find a file, it felt like searching through a library without a catalog.<br><br>
I went there, looked at how they worked, and realized what they needed—a digital record system that mapped their file paths, just like a library management system.<br><br>
I chose Flask for the backend. It was my first backend framework, and I pushed myself to learn fast. In a single day, I got the basics: dynamic rendering with Jinja2, routes, and server-side templates. Step by step, I picked up more—authentication, ORM, forms—and built the system.<br><br>
Even though it was my first project, I tried to follow best practices and use the right tools: Flask-SQLAlchemy for the database, Flask-WTF for forms. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend<br><br>
The system had role-based authentication, with different roles like admin and visitor. It wasn’t just functional—it felt like a proper, professional solution.<br><br>
Looking back, this project taught me how quickly I could learn when I really committed. It was the first time I felt like I wasn’t just coding for fun—I was solving a real-world problem.<br><br>
