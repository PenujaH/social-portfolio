            ISM Robotics Club was the first club I ever joined. Honestly, none of us knew much at the beginning—we were all complete newbies. But that’s what made it exciting.<br><br>
We started with the basics: learning about Arduino and ESP32 microcontrollers. Slowly, it all began to click. Wires, sensors, and tiny circuits turned into something real.<br><br>
Soon, we started building projects together. A remote-controlled Bluetooth car. Obstacle detection gadgets. Even a four-legged spider robot. They weren’t perfect, but they were ours—and we made them work as a team.<br><br>
Through this, we learned more than just electronics and IoT. We learned how to start from zero, how to experiment, how to fail and try again.<br><br>
Joining ISM Robotics Club showed me how much you can do with curiosity, teamwork, and a few lines of code.<br><br>
