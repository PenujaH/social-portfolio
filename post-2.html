            <p>Python was my First Love</p>
        </div>
        <p class="content">Python was my first love. When I started taking a Python course, I was so excited literally, it felt like falling in love for the first time. I learned from one of the best programming teachers in the country, Professor Damitha Karunarathne, at IIT Professional Development Unit. It was a basic professional course, but even though it was simple, it gave me a solid foundation.<br><br>
Python just clicked with me. Learning coding felt awesome. I could understand concepts easily from data types and for loops to OOP. Only OOP was a bit tough at first, but that happens to everyone.<br><br>
After the course, I moved to GUI applications. I made todo apps and different kinds of GUI apps. Then my mom gave me a project at her office: digitize their record room. I didn’t know the best way to build an app, so I learned Flask. I picked up concepts like dynamic rendering, databases, and routing quickly. I was a fast learner, and within a week, I even learned ORM, forms, and authentication. I built the record room app with Python and Flask. You can read more about that project in another post.<br><br>
Later, I explored Pygame and built Space Invaders from scratch with no tutorials or references. Just me and the problem. From there, I kept pushing myself and eventually built a real-time strategy game with Python, with unit selection, attack/run animations, and enemy AI, all solved by me, on my own. I also made an RPG duel fighting game, kind of like Street Fighter.<br><br>
Python keeps me going. Learning and building things with it has been my escape, my challenge, and my passion.<br><br>
Python will always be my first love.</p>
